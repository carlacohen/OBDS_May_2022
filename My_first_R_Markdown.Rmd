## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Now let's add some code
```{r}
d <- "hello world"
d
```

## Render the document
You can either use the "Knit" button above or the following line of code
But you need to run this not when inside this R Markdown file or it will enter an infinite loop!
eval=FALSE means that this chunk will not be run
The .html output is saved in the same location as the .rmd file (in this case in the git repository)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render("My_first_R_Markdown.Rmd")
```
